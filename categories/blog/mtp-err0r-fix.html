                        First we need to know about <span class="bold">MTP</span> (Media Transfer Protocol) that we used
                        between our mobile devices to pc for tranfering any thing!

                    overview</p>
                <figure id="paragraph">
                    The main purpose of this protocol is to allow only the transfer of media files and associated
                    metadata to and from portable devices, one transfer function, in or out, at a time. It does not
                    support operations such as open, edit and modify. A workaround is to copy to the hosting system for
                    these operations and then copy back. A battery-powered mobile device can report its battery charge
                    level through MTP.

                    The protocol was originally implemented for use across USB but extended for use across TCP/IP and
                    Bluetooth. Windows Vista supports MTP over TCP/IP. Windows 7 and Windows Vista with the Platform
                    Update for Windows Vista also support MTP over Bluetooth. The host connecting to an MTP device is
                    called an MTP Initiator whereas the device itself is an MTP Responder.

                    A main reason for using MTP rather than, for example, the USB mass-storage device class (MSC) is
                    that the latter operates at the granularity of a mass storage device block (usually in practice, a
                    FAT block), rather than at the logical file level. In other words, the USB mass storage class is
                    designed to give a host computer undifferentiated access to bulk mass storage, such as compact
                    flash, rather than to a file system, which might be safely shared with the target device (except for
                    specific files which the host might be modifying/accessing). In practice, therefore, when a USB host
                    computer has mounted an MSC partition, it assumes absolute control of the storage, which then may
                    not be safely modified by the device without risk of data corruption until the host computer has
                    severed the connection. Furthermore, because the host computer has full control over the connected
                    storage device, there is a risk that the host computer may corrupt the file system, reformat it to a
                    file system not supported by the USB device, or otherwise modify it in such a way that the USB
                    device cannot completely understand it.

                    MTP and PTP specifically overcome this issue by making the unit of managed storage a local file
                    rather than an entire (possibly very large) unit of mass storage at the block level. In this way,
                    MTP works like a transactional file system - either the entire file is written/read or nothing. The
                    storage media is not affected by failed transfers.

                    Where the device maintains a database/index of the content of the disk, MTP saves the cost of
                    re-scanning the entire disk every time the content is modified.

                    Additionally, the MTP allows MTP Initiators to identify the specific capabilities of device(s) with
                    respect to file formats and functionality. In particular, MTP Initiators may have to provide
                    passwords and other information to unlock files, or otherwise enable digital rights management.
                    Nothing specific of this nature is in the core standard but the features are available via vendor
                    extensions. MTPZ, the Zune Extension to MTP specifically denies access to files until authentication
                    has been processed, which is only possible using Windows Media Player 10 or higher.

                <figure id="sub-paragraph" >
                    According to mine and how i solve that Problem<br>First update your System drivers mean USB hub
                    controller drivers by using free online tool <span>Driver Booster</span> install and open it this
                    will auto detect and install drivers that are missing from your pc!
                    <br>
                    This problem occour when we install other vendors drivers that use MTP protocol ,other drivers
                    confilting with preinstalled drivers provided by microsoft working perfectly
                    when we clean install windows & then attach android device and our pc automatically detect model of
                    device without problem
                    when we install any GSM device software like Chimera this software install all drivers include mtp
                    that develops by chimera holder this make confilting and say errors
                    <br>
                    Errors comeup because in I/O unit oprating system using Interface between devices for avoiding from
                    data corruption/confilting
                    so when we install other drivers from other vendor provider/maker have different mind to solve so
                    that why driver included in software for working these software perfect <br>
                    so when device is attached Interface id is changed and Pc don't Detect device some developers
                    develop Tool that help here to move out from Interface id confilting
                    <br>
                    let's move to tool that help us here!
